COMMENTS
Any text which begins with an explicit markup start but
doesn't use the syntax of any of the constructs above.

.. This text will not be shown 
   (but, for instance, in HTML might be 
   rendered as an HTML comment)

An "empty comment", i.e., ".." with blank lines before 
and after, doesn't consume following blocks. 

.. 

    So this block is not "lost", despite its indentation.
