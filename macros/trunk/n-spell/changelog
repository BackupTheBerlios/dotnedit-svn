 - nechoesd: different path handling using NEDIT_HOME
 - n-spell.nm : different path handling using NEDIT_HOME


From BETA to 1.0
=================

 - Implemented skipping of LaTeX math environments.

 - Completed installation instructions and manual.

 - Fixed Spelling -> Toggle Continuous.

 - Removed Spelling -> Initialise N-spell.  Use Toggle Continuous
   instead.

 - Renamed Rescan Document to Check File/Selection.

 - When checking the whole file with Check File/Selection, look
   for doublons, too.

 - Added variable for backlight color marking doublons.

 - Fixed nspell_removeTags() (which turns off the backlight color by
   removing the words from the rangeset or by destroying rangesets.)

 - Fixed nspell_selectLanguage(), so that it works if N-spell wasn't
   initialized yet.

 - Added missing compatibility functions required for Cygwin.
