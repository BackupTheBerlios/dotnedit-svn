This is a short list of differences between N-spell and Nechoes 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/nechoes).

- N-spell uses rangesets to backlight misspelled words
  (This feature wasn't available when Nechoes was written.)

- To rescan the whole document, or a part thereof, N-spell invokes a
  new Aspell process via shell_command().

- N-spell caches misspelled words, so that the spell-checker needn't
  be used for them again.

- To verify that on-the-fly checking can be used, N-spell checks
  also for the Aspell process that the Nechoesd process invokes.
  (If Nechoesd is called for a language not installed for Aspell,
  the Nechoesd process keeps running but Aspell gets disabled.
  Nechoes checked only if Nechoesd is running and hangs when trying
  to read the FIFOs.)

- N-spell tries to respects the syntax of a file (no checking in HTML
  tags and so on).

- N-spell has mouse bindings, so that you needn't put the cursor on
  the misspelled word to get suggestions - just move the mouse
  pointer to it and click Ctrl+btn3.

- N-spell doesn't use your locale settings to test for valid words.
  You can define the letter characters for a language on your own,
  so that you can do German spell-checking in one window and French
  spell-checking in another window in the same session.
  (N-spell is prepared for English, French, German, and Spanish.)
  In addition, switching the language doesn't require to switch your
  locale settings.  (Personally, I customized the NEdit key bindings
  in such a way that I can write German like on a German keyboard
  but at the same time I have all the brackets available for writing
  LaTeX code.  Switching the keyboard layout can't compete.  So my
  locale is usually just C, when writing German.)
