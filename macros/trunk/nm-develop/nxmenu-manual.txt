 NEdit Menu Extraction

:Abstract:
      This collection of macros provides an easy extraction of NEdit's
      menu definitions and language modes from ``nedit.rc`` files, so
      that others can import them into their ``nedit.rc`` file.





Extracting Menu Items
=====================
Extract a whole language mode, i.e., patterns, macros, and smart indent
macros.  Macros defined by ``@language mode``.  Done!

I need to handle different formats!  My More Customizable Menus format
can't be shared with the original NEdit.  If I extract from mine, move
the extracted file, edit, and search menu entries to the macro menu with
prefix ``File Menu>``, ``Edit Menu>``, and ``Search Menu>``,
respectively.  Done!  See ``jf_transform_compatible()``

**But** what I missed is possible ``macro_menu_command()`` calls!  For
instance, my word completion macros called themselves with the
``macro_menu_command()``.  When I moved them to the Edit menu, I had to
replace these calls with ``edit_menu_command()``.  There are also
``file_menu_command()`` and ``search_menu_command()``.  To transform
this back, the word completion macros are moved to the Macro menu under
``Edit Menu>...``.  Then the ``edit_menu_command("Name")`` call must be
transformed into ``macro_menu_command("Edit Menu>Name")``.
