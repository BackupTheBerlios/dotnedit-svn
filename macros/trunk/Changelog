 - tcl_hook into assistant, so latexmode needn't be loaded.  We see
   ``tcl_hook`` as general interface independent from latexmode, hence
   the variable ``$tk`` should be set in ``tcl_hook``, and not in
   latexmode.
 - ``ltx_assistant()`` renamed to ``tcl_assistant()`` and moved to
   ``tcl_hook``. Maybe we should rename ``tcl_hook.nm`` to
   ``tcl_interface.nm``
   
 - In this connection, we use ``$daemon`` which depends on the shell in
   use.  Why we don't have an internal ``$command_shell`` variable?
 
 - latexmode: 
 
   * ltx_insert() depends on $data via menu call in nedit.rc
   
   * global array to reduce the number of global variables
   
     + this allows for if defined checks, so we reduce interdependencies
     + allows fine tuning
     + currently, the color chooser for SGML/HTML depends on latexmode!
 
 - keyboard handling (we can hide menus)
