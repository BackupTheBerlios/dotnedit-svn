 - move word completion for latex from code_word_comp.nm to 
   latex_mode.nm 

 - use new setup with jf_require()

 - $windows renamed to $os_system with values mswindows, linux
 - pdfopen, pdfclose, ltx_preview, $ltx_mode (dvi or pdf)
   [Test the thing on linux!]
 - (un)comment with right mouse click
 - fix in spell_filter for \cite[]



Changes from 0.9 to 0.9.1:
==========================

 - simple test if we are on MS Windows using MiKTeX
   (variable $windows was mistakenly set to "true", which 
    caused shell commands to fail on Unix/Linux)
 
 - enhancements for the spell-checking macro 
   (following a user request)



Changes from 0.8a to 0.9:
=========================

 New features:

 - Ctrl+m extended for \begin/\end matching (and $ matching)

 - changing brackets and environments (e.g. $...$ <-> \[...\])
 
 - goto next/previous \begin

 - added macro to insert nomenclature entries
 
 - added possibility of "hypersearch" for labels 


 Bug fixes:

 - fixed: \\cite\l*[t,p]?{one,two,three}
 
 - fixed: Sections with optional argument were not found
 
 - added missing `Jump back' (after jumping to reference)
 
 - excluded comments and text after \endinput from finding 
   labels, sections, etc.
 
 - removed bogus keybindings for Ctrl+w and Ctrl+q
 
 - removed KP Enter binding 



Changes from 0.8 to 0.8a:
=========================

 - fix in ltx_list_citations(): Skip @string/@preamble

 - fix for completing references and citations

 - fix in ltx_insert_lists(): Skip \begin-\end blocks

 - added keyword search for citations

 - added more examples to example.tex

 - improved the manual



Changes from 0.5 to 0.8:
========================

 - Restructuring: All macros have been defined as functions
   (subroutines) and are stored in files. The menu entries contain
   only calls to these functions. 

 - .dat file format: Changed the separators in the .dat files to
   (hopefully) unused ASCII characters (< 128), so that the
    LaTeX-Mode can also be used with languages like Russian.

 - Key-bindings: Writing German on a US keyboard layout.

 - Equations: Skipping \begin-\end blocks, so that equations can
   contain matrices.

 - TeX Shell: Showing errors in calltips. Debug mode. Use of Source
   Specials. Small .log file mode.

 - References: Quick information in calltips. Fix "by Proposition
   \ref{foobar}" to "by Lemma \ref{foobar}", when the environment
   of \label{foobar} was changed from Proposition to Lemma.

 - Syntax Highlighting: Enriched LaTeX patterns, new BibTeX
   patterns, DTX-Mode (not yet fully integrated with the LaTeX-Mode)

 - Sectioning: Now aware of KOMA additions.

 - Expansions/Completions: Bug fixes, more completions.
